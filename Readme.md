# Bet Tracking Application

The goal of this site is to allow users to create profiles that will track,
chart, and provide statistics of the performance of the sports bets they make
over time. Additionally, I hope to allow a timeline to be created that will
highlight winning bets of other users, share streaks, and allow a community to
develop around users sharing line tips, insights, and celebrating strong
performances.
